"""
Feature flags Pyramid extension.

A feature flags Pyramid extension that supports reading feature flags from
multiple sources including:

- The config file
- Environment variables
- A feature flags cookie
- URL query string parameters
- Custom providers (you could add providers for reading feature flags from a
  database, a feature flags microservice queried over HTTPS, ...)

Usage
=====

First include the extension in your app's configuration::

    config.include("lms.extensions.feature_flags")

This adds a ``request.feature(feature_flag_name)`` method that you can use to
query whether a given feature flag is active or not for the request. For
example::

  if request.feature("my_feature"):
      ...
  else:
      ...

Behind the scenes an ordered list of "feature flag providers" are queried that
consult different sources to see if the feature flag has been enabled or
disabled.

By default no sources are consulted and ``request.feature()`` always returns
``False``. You have to explicitly add the sources you want, in the order you
want, by calling ``add_feature_flag_providers()``. For example::

    config.add_feature_flag_providers(
        "lms.extensions.feature_flags.config_file_provider",
        "lms.extensions.feature_flags.envvar_provider",
        "lms.extensions.feature_flags.query_string_provider",
    )

Provider Ordering
=================

Providers are called in the order in which they were added.  The *last*
provider to return ``True`` or ``False`` (rather than ``None``) overrides all
other providers, so the order in which the providers are added matters.

Builtin Providers
=================

``config_file_provider``
------------------------

Enable or disable feature flags in the app's config file.

Usage::

    config.add_feature_flag_providers("lms.extensions.feature_flags.config_file_provider", ...)

To enable or disable feature flags in your app's config file add
``feature_flags.* = true|false`` lines to the file, one line per feature flag.
For example::

    [app:main]
    feature_flags.foo = true
    feature_flags.bar = false

``envvar_provider``
-------------------

Enable or disable feature flags using environment variables.

Usage::

    config.add_feature_flag_providers("lms.extensions.feature_flags.envvar_provider", ...)

To enable or disable feature flags add ``FEATURE_FLAG_*=true|false``
environment variables, one envvar per feature flag. For example::

    export FEATURE_FLAG_FOO=true
    export FEATURE_FLAG_BAR=false

``cookie_provider``
-------------------

Enable or disable feature flags using a browser cookie.

Usage::

    config.add_feature_flag_providers("lms.extensions.feature_flags.cookie_provider", ...)

This will add a ``/flags`` page to your app that you can visit to enable or disable
feature flags in your browser's feature flags cookie.

To use this provider you need to add two deployment settings to your ``.ini`` file:

``feature_flags_cookie_secret`` is a secret string that'll be used to sign the
feature flags cookie::

  feature_flags_cookie_secret = "notasecret"

You can generate a suitable ``feature_flags_cookie_secret`` string like this::

  python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'

``feature_flags_allowed_in_cookie`` is a list of the feature flags that can be
toggled on or off in the cookie and that will appear on the ``/flags`` page::

  feature_flags_allowed_in_cookie = my_feature my_other_feature

``query_string_provider``
-------------------------

Enable or disable feature flags using URL query string parameters.

Usage::

    config.add_feature_flag_providers("lms.extensions.feature_flags.query_string_provider", ...)

To enable or disable feature flags add ``?feature_flags.foo=true|false``
parameters to the query string. For example::

    https://example.com/some/page?feature_flags.foo=true&feature_flag.bar=false

Custom Providers
================

You can write your own providers and add them by passing them to
``config.add_feature_flag_provider()`` in the same way as you would add one of
the builtin providers.  Each provider must be a callable that takes the request
as its first argument and the feature flag name (a string) as it second
argument and returns ``False`` if the flag has been explicitly disabled by its
source, ``True`` if it has been enabled, or ``None`` if the feature flag isn't
set by that source. For example::

    def hardcoded_provider(request, feature_flag_name):
        if feature_flag_name == "enabled_feature_flag":
            return True
        elif feature_flag_name == "disabled_feature_flag":
            return False
