"""
Views for handling what the LTI spec calls "Basic LTI Launches".

A Basic LTI Launch is the form submission POST request that an LMS sends us
when it wants our app to launch an assignment, as opposed to other kinds of
LTI launches such as the Content Item Selection launches that some LMS's
send us while *creating* a new assignment.

The spec requires Basic LTI Launch requests to have an ``lti_message_type``
parameter with the value ``basic-lti-launch-request`` to distinguish them
from other types of launch request (other "message types") but our code
doesn't actually require basic launch requests to have this parameter.

Note: The views in this module are currently used only when the new_oauth
feature flag is on. They replace legacy views from ``lti_launches.py``
that're still used when the feature flag is off.
