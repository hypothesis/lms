    Some LTI assignments are "DB-configured" meaning the assignment's

    This happens with LMS's that don't support LTI "content item selection"
    (also known as "deep linking"), so they don't support storing the
    assignment configuration (document URL) in the LMS.

    view only for requests whose assignment has its configuration stored in our
    DB. Pass ``db_configured=False`` to allow invoking the view for assignments
    that are *not* DB-configured.
