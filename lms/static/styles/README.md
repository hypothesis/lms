# CSS Styling for LMS

There are currently three CSS stylesheets generated from source here:

- `frontend_apps`: The CSS to style the (front-end) LMS application
- `lms`: Used by LMS app (back-end) views (see `lms/templates/base.html.jinja2`). These styles should be reviewed at some point and evaluated for conversion to Tailwind, if feasible.
- `ui-playground`: Styles for this project's Pattern Library, served at `/ui-playground`
