// Shared pattern-library styles

// The app CSS uses utility and component styles, but not pattern styles.
// Include them here so that the patterns in the Patterns section of pages
// are styled.
@use '@hypothesis/frontend-shared/styles/patterns';
// Include the CSS for the Library components themselves
@use '@hypothesis/frontend-shared/styles/library';

// Application CSS styles the containing main content block as a centered flex column.
// This looks peculiar with the pattern-library pages, which vary in width,
// so override it.
.content {
  display: block;
