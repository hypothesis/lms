Feature: Section 3 - Types of User Roles

  This section performs a variety of launch requests with different values
  for the roles parameter.

      And the assignment has been launched before

    # Expected result: User should have whatever privileges are appropriate
    # to an instructor; e.g. able to edit

    Given the user is 'Jane'
      And I set the fixture 'params' key 'roles' to 'urn:lti:role:ims/lis/Instructor'
